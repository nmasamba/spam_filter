# Spam classifier written in Python

****************************************************************

To run spam filter from command line:

python filter.py <testfile.txt>

For example, to run the spam filter on the ham_test email:

python filter.py ham_test.txt

***************************************************************

The other Python script can be run in the same manner. Also note
that the finalised_clf file is a file containing pre-trained
classifier results so that the filter does not have to re-train.
